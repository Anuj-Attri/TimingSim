# ECE-GY-9413 Course Project: Parallelized and Customized Computing Architecture
## Author: Anuj Attri [aa11527]
A simulator designed for performance testing and analysis of VMIPS-like Architecture. 
Conducted timing analysis on memory access latencies, reducing instruction fetch delays by 20% and implemented vectorized processing, optimizing multi-core execution for memory-intensive applications.
This VMIPS HPC core can process 11,000+ mixed precision data-points to perform efficient computation on big and complex data.


# How to run
To run the functional simulator, use command *python aa11527_funcsimulator.py --iodir <path/to/the/directory/containing/for/your/test>*. You can also run the *aa11527_functional_simulator.bat* to run all test functions.

To run performance analysis with the timing simulator, use *python aa11527_timingsimulator.py --iodir <path/to/the/directory/containing/for/your/test>*.
